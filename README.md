# Team-Big-Data-Group-Project
This is a group project of an analysis of a dataset for WHO. The goal of this project is to draw insight and findings from the dataset. Based on findings from this analysis, WHO will then establish a framework that it will use to allocate resources in different regions.

## Source of Data
Two datasets were used in this analysis. The first dataset used was extracted from: https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death, where information about different causes of death in the world was available. The accessed database was ‘The Number of deaths by cause, World, 2017’. The second dataset was extracted from: https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/Metadata/en/Country/All, where data about different regions and income groups was available. The accessed database was ‘Country Metadata’.

### Programming Languages for Analysis
In this project, Python programming language was used to analyze the dataset. Pandas and numpy libraries were imported to enable code execution. Google colaboratory notebook was used to write and execute the code, and data analysis.
